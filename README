                                ordCalc_0.3.2

This is an interactive tool to understand and perhaps eventually expand
notations for countable ordinals.

It has a command line interpreter resembling calculators.
See 'ordCalc.pdf' for a description of how to use the interpreter.
See 'ordinal.pdf' for a description of the structure of the program and the
theory on which it is based.

VERSIONS:

A Microsoft Windows installation built with Visual C++ is available as either
a stand alone executable or a standard installation file. It runs on windows
XP and later and on the Wine Windows emulator.

The source code version should build on most Linux and many Unix systems.
It also has support for a build under Visual C++.


REQUIREMENTS:

The Win32 executable ord.exe requires no additional support. It has been
tested on XP and Windows 7 and is assumed to work on Vista. It also works on
Wine, the Windows' emulator.

The source build on Linux requires the mpir ( http://mpir.org ) and
readline ( http://directory.fsf.org/project/readline/ ) libraries. The
largely compatible gmp ( http://gmplib.org" ) library can be used
instead of mpir by modifying the Makefile in ordCalc_0.3.2/src

The source build on Visual C++ requires the mpir ( http://mpir.org ) 
libraries.


BUILDING ordCalc_0.3.2 under Linux/Unix

First make sure you have the mpir and readline libraries and development
packages installed. This includes mpir.lib mpirxx.lib, mpir.h, mpirxx.h,
readline.lib, readline/readline.h and readline/history.h

If these are not installed you may be able to include them with the
commands as super user:
yum install mpir-devel
yum install readline-devel

To build the program on most Linux and Unix based
platforms type 'make' in this directory. The output is file 'ord'
in subdirectory 'src' and a series of tests to validate the installation.
There should be a log of test results in src/test.log

To run these tests again type 'make TEST' in this directory or 'src'.

BUILDING ordCalc_0.3.2 Windows and Visual C++

You will probably need to download the source for the mpir multiprecision
arithmetic package and build it.  The existing build for ordCalc_0.3.2 uses
static libraries and is a release build. It assumes the mpir libraries
(mpir.lib and mpirxx.lib) are in ordCalc_0.3.2/src/msw/mswLib/Debug or
ordCalc_0.3.2/src/msw/mswLib/Release depending on the build type.
It also assumes the mpir includes (mpir.h and mpirxx.h)
are in ordCalc_0.3.2/src/msw/mswInc. Once
you have downloaded or built these and put them in place your can click
on the Visual C++ file: ordCalc_0.3.2/src/msw/ordCalc_0.3.2/ordCalc_0.3.2.sln
to load the build for ordCalc_0.3.2 into Visual C++.

To run the full validation tests you also need to have installed Cygwin.
In a Cygwin window go to directory ordCalc_0.3.2/src and enter the command
bash mswTest.sh


BUILDING DOCUMENTATION under Linux/Unix or CYGWIN under Windows:

To build the program and documentation type 'make ALL' in this directory.
There should be a prebuilt version of the documentation (ordinal.pdf and
ordCalc.pdf) in this directory. There is no need to build them unless
you edit the documentation.

A portion of the documentation is created by program 'ord' and it must
be built first. You need to have a fairly complete TeX/LaTeX installation to
build the documentation. To do so type 'make DOC' in this top level directory.
