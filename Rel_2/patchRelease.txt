Some problems have been encountered in this release in validation under
NetBSD and they many affect other operating systems. These only affect the
validation output and not the functioning of the ordinal calculator itself.

'patch1', contributed by Ignatios Souvatzis, should be used in the 'src'
directory to fix a problem in the order in which validation output is
displayed.  (Type 'patch < patch1' in that directory).

In addition line 40 in the Makefile in the 'src' directory should be changed
from "time bash srTest.sh 2>&1 | tee test.log"
to "bash srTest.sh | tee test.log" to avoid the possibility that the timing
output will be merged with the summary statistics in a confusing way.
