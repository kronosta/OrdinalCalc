Release notes for ordCalc version 0.2.0

This is the second release of the ordinal calculator. It corrects bugs
in version 0.1.0. The major problems corrected from that release are exiting
instead of crashing on user end of file and a corrected comparison that in
rare cases produced incorrect results.  Spelling errors and typos were also
corrected. This remains a beta release because it the programs functions
have been substantially expanded.

Version 0.1.0 supported ordinal notation up to but not including the
large Veblen ordinal. This version (0.2.0) supports recursive ordinals up to
and somewhat beyond the Bachmann-Howard ordinal. This is accomplished by
supporting notations for countable ordinals greater than the Church-Kleene
ordinal (the ordinal of the recursive ordinals) and using a new form of
ordinal collapsing on these nonrecursive ordinals to construct large
recursive ordinals.

The Microsoft Windows version of this program has a known problem with
line editing. If you have CYGWIN installed you can fix this problem by
installing ord.exe in the CYGWIN bin directory. To do this you may need
to rebuild ord.exe under your version of CYGWIN
